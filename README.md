## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Download and Place Script**
   ```powershell
   # Place the script in your desired location
   # Example: C:\Scripts\SharePointAssessmentTool_V1.0.ps1
   ```

2. **Open SharePoint Management Shell as Administrator**
   ```powershell
   # Run SharePoint Management Shell as Administrator
   ```

3. **Execute the Script**
   ```powershell
   .\SharePointAssessmentTool_V1.0.ps1
   ```

4. **Specify Output Directory**
   ```
   Enter the full path (without filename) to save the reports (e.g., C:\temp): C:\SharePointReports
   ```

5. **Review Generated Reports**
   - Main HTML Report: `[ServerName]-SharePointReport.html`
   - Individual CSV files: `[ServerName]-[Category].csv`

## üìÅ Output Structure

The tool generates the following files in your specified directory:

### HTML Report
- `[ServerName]-SharePointReport.html` - Interactive HTML report with all assessment data

### CSV Data Files (32 files)
- `[ServerName]-SPServers.csv` - SharePoint server information
- `[ServerName]-WebApplications.csv` - Web application details
- `[ServerName]-SiteCollections.csv` - Site collection inventory
- `[ServerName]-SPDatabases.csv` - Content database information
- `[ServerName]-SPSecurity.csv` - Security configuration details
- `[ServerName]-TLSSettings.csv` - TLS/SSL configuration

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
- Reports may contain sensitive configuration information
- Service account details are included in outputs
- Database connection strings and server details are captured
- Store reports in secure locations with appropriate access controls

### Network Security
- Tool performs local assessments only
- No data transmitted outside the assessed environment
- All queries are read-only operations

### Permissions Impact
- Requires elevated privileges for complete assessment
- Some checks may fail with insufficient permissions
- Error handling prevents script interruption

## üîß Customization

### Adding Custom Assessments
The modular design allows easy extension:
```powershell
# Add new assessment section
$customAssessment = Get-CustomSharePointData
$csvCustom = Join-Path -Path $Path -ChildPath "$ServerName-Custom.csv"
$customAssessment | Export-Csv -Path $csvCustom -NoTypeInformation
$htmlSections['Custom'] = $customAssessment | ConvertTo-Html -Fragment -PreContent "<h2>Custom Assessment</h2>"
```

### Modifying Output Paths
Edit the file path definitions section:
```powershell
$csvCustomFile = Join-Path -Path $path -ChildPath "$ServerName-CustomName.csv"
```

### Customizing HTML Styling
The HTML template includes comprehensive CSS that can be modified for corporate branding or styling preferences.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**SharePoint PowerShell Module Not Found**
```powershell
# Ensure SharePoint Management Shell is installed
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**Access Denied Errors**
- Verify Farm Administrator privileges
- Check local Administrator rights
- Ensure SQL Server connectivity

**Performance Issues**
- Large environments may take 15-30 minutes to complete
- Consider running during maintenance windows
- Monitor server resources during execution

**Incomplete Data Collection**
- Review PowerShell execution policy
- Check Windows Update service status
- Verify WMI service availability

### Error Handling
The script includes comprehensive error handling:
- Individual section failures don't stop overall assessment
- Error messages are captured in the HTML report
- Partial data collection continues even with some failures
